#  From Chaos to Clarity: Structuring Workforce Insight for Scalable Decision-Making

**Case Study – Orgvue Analyst Role | Organizational Design & Planning | Sydney**

## ✅ Context

In exploring how mid-to-large organizations handle workforce planning, I noticed a recurring challenge: decisions were often reactive, lacked structure, and failed to align with strategic goals.  

To simulate a real-world solution, I crafted a consulting-style project for a **1,500-employee e-commerce company** facing:

- High attrition in regional operations roles  
- Role duplication across departments  
- Low visibility into workforce ROI  

This became a hands-on application of **Data-Driven Organizational Design (DDOD)** principles—aligned with Orgvue’s mission to model better-performing organizations.

---

## ✅ Objective

> Create a scalable workforce planning model that identifies inefficiencies, visualizes role cost vs. value, and enables future-ready operating decisions.

---

## ✅ Approach

### 1. Data Collection & Architecture

- Cleaned and normalized simulated HRIS data:  
  `Role`, `Region`, `Function`, `Salary Band`, `Tenure`, `FTE`, `Attrition`, `Performance Rating`
- Built a structured role hierarchy and created strategic tags:  
  *"Critical Role"*, *"Back-office Support"*, *"Underperforming High-Cost"*

### 2. Analytical Modeling & Visualization

- Segmented workforce into:
  - **Strategic**, **Operational**, and **Redundant** clusters
- Created dashboards using **Tableau**:
  - Headcount by role type and region  
  - Cost vs productivity per department  
  - Attrition risk zones by tenure and region
- Simulated future-state modeling over 4 quarters

### 3. Organizational Design & Storytelling

- Proposed a redesign plan:
  - Cut 20% redundant roles and reinvest in high-impact positions  
  - Introduced cross-functional regional pods to minimize bottlenecks
- Presented findings as a client-style **data-backed strategic deck**
